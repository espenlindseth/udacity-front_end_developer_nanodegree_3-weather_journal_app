# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This is a project for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. The basic idea is to take a basic template site that they've provided, and set up a node environment with express, configure get/post routes, use the fetch api to get data from a third party site, and chain promises together to update the basic UI.

The first commit contains the provided template code, any subsequent commits thereafter will contain my work to deliver on the Project Rubric.


## Instructions
To run this, clone it or download it, make sure you have node installed. I used v10.15.3.

Then you may have to run these commands:
`node --version`
`npm install express`
`npm install body-parser`
`npm install cors`
